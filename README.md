Running this brings up a prompt to select folder where DATA is kept at.
After selection, the python file runs to produce graphs and a concat .xls file.
To edit, both the .cmd file and the .py file will have to be edited in harmony.
Note that file directory for .py is hard coded at the moment.

Before running: Make sure that 1) Anaconda or equivalent is installed in user path variable
2) the .cmd file references the correct .py path
